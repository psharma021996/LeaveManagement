# LeaveManagement
for leave Management project in LWC
Introduction:
ABC Corp. is a budding Salesforce-based startup. Its employees, prioritizing their product
development activities, did not implement a system to track HR procedures like time-off
requests.
This lack of communication between departments has made it difficult for employees to apply for
leaves, for their managers to track and approve their leave requests, and for HR to keep the
database updated.
Your first task as their latest recruit to the development team is to develop a full-stack leave
management application using Apex and LWC. Ensure that your app has the facilities for
employees to conveniently apply for leaves, management to track and approve, and an easily
understandable database for HR to monitor
